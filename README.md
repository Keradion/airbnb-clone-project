Airbnb Clone Project
Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone project simulates a real-world booking platform. It focuses on backend systems, database design, API development, and security. The goal is to build a scalable, secure, and maintainable web application using modern development practices.

Tech Stack: Django, MySQL, GraphQL, Docker, GitHub Actions

Team Roles

Backend Developer: Implements server-side logic, APIs, and database interactions.

Database Administrator: Designs and manages relational databases, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

DevOps Engineer: Maintains CI/CD pipelines, deployment workflows, and system reliability.

Frontend Developer: Integrates the frontend with backend APIs (if applicable).

QA Engineer: Tests the application to ensure correct functionality and quality.

Technology Stack

Django: A web framework for building RESTful APIs efficiently.

MySQL: Relational database to store users, bookings, properties, and payments.

GraphQL: Provides flexible and efficient data querying for frontend consumption.

Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments.

GitHub Actions: Automates CI/CD pipelines for testing, building, and deployment.

Database Design

Entities & Key Fields:

User: id, name, email, password, role

Property: id, title, description, location, owner_id

Booking: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date

Review: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment

Payment: id, booking_id, amount, status

Relationships:

A user can own multiple properties.

A booking belongs to a single user and property.

Reviews are linked to both users and properties.

Payments are associated with bookings.

Feature Breakdown

User Management: Allows registration, login, and profile management.

Property Management: Enables creation, updating, and deletion of property listings.

Booking System: Users can book properties for selected dates.

Reviews & Ratings: Users can provide feedback on properties.

Payments: Secure handling of booking transactions.

API Security

Authentication: Verifies users before granting access.

Authorization: Restricts actions based on user roles.

Rate Limiting: Prevents abuse and excessive API requests.

Data Protection: Sensitive data, including user information and payments, is encrypted.

Importance: Ensures user privacy, prevents fraud, and secures financial transactions.

CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate testing, integration, and deployment, reducing human error and improving efficiency.

Tools Used: GitHub Actions, Docker
Identify and describe core features of the application, focusing on their relevance to the user experience and business logic.

API Security Fundamentals:

Implement and document key security measures to safeguard application data and ensure secure transactions.

CI/CD Pipeline Integration:

Gain insights into setting up automated development pipelines, boosting efficiency and minimizing errors during the deployment phase.
